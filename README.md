# payments-extractor
For extracting payments from calculated loan products.

Unfinised, unpolished, but WORKING.

Background: a part of my job is testing out loan products to ensure all of them are calculating correct payments. This involved creating a new app, choosing a loan, then digging through the json on the network tab for different values, and when you have 100 loans to look at, it takes a while. With this, I just made my job 100X easier the next time we need to do payments.
